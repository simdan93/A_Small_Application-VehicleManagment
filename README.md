# A Small Application - VehicleManagment

This is but a small console application that creates three objects: Two cars, one plane and a boat, with all the necessary information.
It then checks to see whether the two cars are the same by matching the licenseplate numbers. It is expected that plate nunmbers are unique. 

The app then tells the plane to fly and car number 1 to drive. 

Every information about the transportationvehicles is converted to JSON format using the package Newtonsoft.Json and written to a local .json file.

Software used for editing and testing: Visual Studio Community
