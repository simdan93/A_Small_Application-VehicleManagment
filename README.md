# A Small Application - VehicleManagment

This is but a small console application that creates three objects: Two cars, one plane and a boat, with all the necessary information.
It then checks to see whether the two cars are identical. This check is done by checking the licens plate with the expectancy that it 
is not possible to have two cars with the same number at once.

Then the app tells the plane to fly and car number 1 to drive. 

Every information is converted to JSON format and written to a local .json file.
